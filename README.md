# Mouse-Head-Fixation
Part files and drawings for the mouse head-bars/holders used during IOS &amp; 2P Imaging

https://kl-turner.github.io/Mouse-Head-Fixation/

This repository contains numerous SolidWorks part files, drawing files, and PDFs of those drawing files for numerous head-bar sizes, as well some of the different holders for those head-bars used during imaging. The head-bars are implanted during surgery (**See** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-017-0007-y **and** https://www.jove.com/video/3742/a-polished-reinforced-thinned-skull-window-for-long-term-imaging **for more details**) with the headbar being secured in the holder during data acquisition.

The head-bars are CNC machined from a Titanium sheet (Commerically Pure [CP] Grade 2) of desired thickness due to its biocompatibility, anti-corrosion properties, and overall strength. Titanium is also resistant to acetone, which is used to dissolve the various adhesives to secure the head-bar, thinned-skull windows, electrodes, cannula, and other components during surgery. These bars are designed to be cleaned and re-used indefinitely. 

Headbar holders are CNC machined from an Aluminum sheet (6061-T6511) of desired thickness due to it being easily machinable, light-weight, anti-corrosion properties, and having sufficient strength (there's no significant stresses applied to any part) for the desired applications.
